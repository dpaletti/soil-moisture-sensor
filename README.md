## What's inside?

- **accurate and affordable**: a soil moisture sensor performing in-between
  research grade and consumer hardware at an affordable price (~20€).
- **open and interconnected**: an open-hardware design with an open-source
  mobile app running (natively) on IOS and Android devices together with full
  support for Zigbee, Thread/Matter and Home Automation.
- **carefully designed**: a good looking home accessory which looks slick indoor
  and guarantees water resistance outdoor.

## Why another one

Because existing products do not tick all the boxes.

**Why are we missing ambient temperature and humidity sensing?**

Because these measurements pertain other sensors. Take a balcony with many
plants and many soil moisture sensors, one for each pot. In such case we would
have a lot of redundant measurements which a single cheap specialized sensor can
replace easily. Such measurement is easily integrated in a mobile app
visualization, home integration automation and the like.

**Why are we missing irradiation sensing?**

Because these measurements are rarely reliable and such sensors require
specialized encasing design. Irradiation is an important measure to assess plant
health but the tradeoff between sensor usefulness and added system complexity is
not favorable in this phase.

## When can I have one?

A lot of stuff to get through (contributors welcome!):

- [x] high level product design
- [x] circuit design
- [ ] circuit simulation --> **ongoing in the simulation branch**
- [ ] PCB layout and manufacturing
- [ ] firmware development
- [ ] mobile app development for remote sensor control
- [ ] encasing design
- [ ] testing with early adopters

For a more detailed view of past, ongoing and future activities see
[tasks](TASKS.md).

## How does this make sense?

A product is protected through innovation and branding, not obscurity. Lowering
the barrier of entry for competitors is a low price to pay for a community that
constantly regenerates the product through open collaboration.

**How is this economically viable?**

> Sell the product at the right price point with the right feature set through
> the right suppliers and distributors. Add coherent branding and you are set.
> Definitely not easy but nothing changes from a traditional business.

**How do you prevent other businesses from reselling your product?**

> You don't. Easier replication means that branding and marketing become
> crucial, which is already the case for most businesses. Every product can
> already be reverse engineered and replicated, lowering the replication barrier
> in exchange for community engagement is a net positive.

**How do you get recurring revenues?**

> Professional farmers. Leverage the experience and credibility built in the
> consumer market to develop products for precision agriculture.

**How do you structure an organization stewarding this vision?**

> A worker cooperative with open and democratic governance that:
>
> - contributes to design and development in the open
> - coordinates community contributions democratically
> - sells finished products and adjacent services transparently, without
>   resorting to closed source development.

**How do you finance all this?**

> Bootstrapping, make the business profitable as soon as possible and grow
> organically. We are in for the long run.

As you may have noticed, **I am pitching directly to you**. No notion of
external investors or venture capital, only contributors reaping the benefits of
each other's work.
